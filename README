= Old Timey

Old Timey is a time-logging system which is based around the time.clock format.

It logs task start and end times into ~/.timelog.

== TODO

  # Tab completion?

== Installation

Installing the tool is done through the use of the provided makefile:

----
sudo make install
----

You'll also need to initialise you timelog file before starting:

----
touch ~/.timelog
----

=== Uninstallation

Sometimes, things just don't work out. To remove the tool, you can use the 
uninstall target of the provided Makefile:

----
sudo make uninstall
----

You can optionally throw your timelog file away too.

WARNING: This irrevocably removes your timelog history.

----
rm ~/.timelog
----

== Usage

To start tracking time on a project:

----
timey in development:testing:sk-754
----

You can clock-out of a task at any time:

----
timey out
----

This results in a new set of lines in the timelog:

----
i 2016-07-21 09:00:00 development:testing:sk-754
o 2016-07-21 09:20:00
----

=== Handling interruptions

Interruptions are a fact of life. Old Timey is written with this in mind.

To note that you've had an interruption, use the following command:

----
$> timey int
Interruption category [interruption]?
----

The prompt waits until filled in. Fill it in when the interruption has been 
handled. It then logs the length of the interruption appropriately in the 
timelog.

Note that the default is just "interruption" You're adivsed to categorise
coarsely with this, for example:

----
Interruption type [interruption]: interruption:phone-call
Back on project development:review:sk-123
----

This results in a new addition to the time log:

----
i 2016-07-21 09:00:00 development:testing:sk-754
o 2016-07-21 09:20:00
i 2016-07-21 09:20:00 development:review:sk-123
o 2016-07-21 10:30:00
i 2016-07-21 10:30:00 interruption:phone-call
o 2016-07-21 10:35:00
i 2016-07-21 10:35:00 development:review:sk-123
