= Old Timey

Old Timey is a time-logging system which is based around the time.clock format.

It logs task start and end times into ~/.timelog.

== TODO

  # Tab completion?
  # Interruption support.
  # Installer makefile :-)

== Usage

To start tracking time on a project:

----
timey in development:testing:sk-754
----

You can clock-out of a task at any time:

----
timey out
----

This results in a new set of lines in the timelog:

----
i 2016-07-21 09:00:00 development:testing:sk-754
o 2016-07-21 09:20:00
----

=== Handling interruptions

Interruptions are a fact of life. Old Timey is written with this in mind.

To note that you've had an interruption, use the following command:

----
timey int
----

This stops the previous task and starts an interruption. Once the interuption
is over, use the task:

----
timey on-task
----

This will prompt for a categorisation of the interruption, and a description.

----
Interruption type [interruption]:
Description []:
----

Note that the default is just "interruption" You're adivsed to categorise
coarsely with this, for example:

----
Interruption type [interruption]: interruption:phone-call
Description: customer support call.
----

This results in a new addition to the time log:

----
i 2016-07-21 09:00:00 development:testing:sk-754
o 2016-07-21 09:20:00
i 2016-07-21 09:20:00 development:review:sk-123
o 2016-07-21 10:30:00
i 2016-07-21 10:30:00 interruption:phone-call  customer call
o 2016-07-21 10:35:00
i 2016-07-21 10:35:00 development:review:sk-123
